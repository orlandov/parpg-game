Thank you for downloading PARPG. To get it running, you'll need the FIFE
engine on your computer. So start by visiting them at:

http://fifengine.de/

When you have Fife installed, this directory (/PARPG) needs to be copied into
your /fife/clients directory. You can then run the code with the command
./run.py from /fife/clients/PARPG/ (Windows users may have to use the
command python.exe run.py). You can exit by either pressing Q or closing
the window in the normal way.

Keys:
    Q quits without asking.
    ESC shows the main menu.
    I shows/hides inventory.
    F7 takes a screenshot.
    F5 shows the grid co-ordinates.
    T shows the grid layout.
    M toggles music on and off.

It should be noted that PARPG is in no way a complete game as of yet.
